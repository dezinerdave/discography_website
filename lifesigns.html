    <p>&ldquo;Veteran keyboard player John Young (The Strawbs, John Wetton, Bonnie Tyler, The Scorpions, Fish, Uli Jon Roth, others) realized in 2008 that he had never done a pure prog album. The band LIFESIGNS, is the direct result of that realization. John started writing the music for the first LIFESIGNS album in 2008 working closely with sound engineer and next door neighbor Steve Rispin. As John was often touring with one of the many projects that he was involved in, it took the better part of two years for the writing to have progressed enough to enlist a friend. In 2010, John recruited longtime friend Nick Beggs (Kajagoogoo, Steve Hackett, Steven Wilson, Rick Wakeman, others) to play the bass and Chapman Stick and drummer Frosty Beedle (Cutting Crew) to round out the trio. Over the next two years the band completed their first album, enlisting the talents of prog luminaries Steve Hackett (Genesis) , Jakko Jakszyk (King Crimson), Thijs Van Leer (Focus) and Robin Boult (John Young Band). The band has a modern sound with lush, multi layered keyboards and the distinctive sound of the Chapman stick. John and Nick blend their voices beautifully and frequently throughout their first album in higher pitched harmonies reminiscent of Yes. With the list of musicians that had been compiled for their first album, LIFESIGNS was released with great anticipation in January of 2013.<em> - Tom Wright</em></p>
    <p>&ldquo;The Lifesigns guys are fantastic musicians but they are also the most friendly people I know in this industry. They care for their fans and that leads to a growing following. Something that shows on this live recording. As a band they are getting better and better. The new songs are great and they work on several new ones for the next studio album. This is new prog at its best!&rdquo;<em> - Arne van Os van den Abeelen, Background Magazine</em></p>
    <p>&ldquo;Signs of new modern prog life detected… quintessentially English, modern prog: short and long-form musical structures, layered sound and melodic guitar lines over keyboard washes. Changes of tempo and time signature variations; tenor, high tenor or female vocals commonly utilised to compliment the soaring instrumentation and arrangements… &ldquo;I&apos;m calling out, too far to hear…&rdquo; cries the plaintive voice of John Young on <em>Lighthouse.</em> I hear what you’re saying just fine, John; I just hope and trust many others do, too. Because these Lifesigns deserve to be detected well beyond the borders of Prog-land. &rdquo;<em>- Ross Muir</em></p>
