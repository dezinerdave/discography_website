    <p>Following years of touring with arists like Bon Jovi, The Law, Uli Roth (ex-Scorpions), Steeleye Span, The Strawbs, Bonnie Tyler and John Wetton, plus a series of instrumental and pop-based solo albums, LIFESIGNS was formed in 2008 when veteran rock keyboardist John Young began working with engineer/producer Steve Rispin at his Liscombe Park Studio in the English countryside on the border of Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire. Two years later, joined by ex-Cutting Crew drummer Martin &ldquo;Frosty&rdquo; Beadle and ex-Kajagoogoo bassist and Chapman Stick player Nick Beggs and the addition of sessions from notable guitarists Steve Hackett, Jakko Jakszyk and Robin Boult, plus Focus flautist Thijs Van Leer, the band released their first album in 2013.</p>
    <p>With Nick Beggs booked for another tour with the Steve Hackett Band, LIFESIGNS recruited bassist Jon Poole and noted guitarist Niko Tsonev for a series of live gigs, including the progressive rock cruise ship tour <em>Cruise to the Edge,</em> culminating in the release of their live album <em>Live In London - Under The Bridge</em> in 2015.</p>
    <p>After a successful Pledge Music campaign, LIFESIGNS is set to release their third studio album, <em>Cardington</em>, in 2017.</p>
